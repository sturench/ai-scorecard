# Task ID: 16
# Title: Production Deployment Pipeline & Monitoring Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement complete production deployment with Vercel, environment configuration, health monitoring, and alerting system with DNS configuration, SSL setup, and comprehensive monitoring specifications.
# Details:
**PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Vercel Deployment Configuration:**
- Reference /workspaces/ai-scorecard/implementation-spec/deployment-guide.md for complete deployment requirements
- Vercel project setup with optimized build configuration and edge function deployment
- Environment variable management with production, staging, and preview configurations
- Custom domain configuration with DNS settings and SSL certificate automation
- Build optimization with static generation and incremental static regeneration (ISR)
- Edge function deployment for API routes with regional optimization
- Database connection pooling and production-ready connection strings

**Environment & Configuration Management:**
- Production environment variables with secure secret management
- Database migration strategy for production deployment
- CDN configuration for static assets and image optimization
- Rate limiting and API throttling for production traffic
- CORS configuration for production domains
- Security headers implementation (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

**Health Monitoring & Alerting System:**
- Application health checks with endpoint monitoring (/api/health)
- Real-time performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking
- Error tracking and exception monitoring with Sentry integration
- Database connection monitoring and query performance tracking
- Uptime monitoring with 99.9% availability target
- Automated alerting system for critical failures and performance degradation
- Log aggregation and structured logging for production debugging
- Monitoring dashboard with key metrics visualization

**Production Readiness Checklist:**
- Security audit and penetration testing preparation
- Load testing with expected traffic patterns
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance optimization with lighthouse scoring >90
- Analytics integration validation for production traffic
- Session management testing under production load

# Test Strategy:
**PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT TDD TESTING:**

**RED Phase - Infrastructure Tests:**
- Test Vercel deployment configuration with build verification and edge function validation
- Validate environment variable loading across production, staging, and preview environments
- Test custom domain configuration with DNS resolution and SSL certificate validation
- Test database connection pooling under production load conditions
- Validate health check endpoints return proper status codes and response times

**Production Monitoring Tests:**
- Test real-time performance monitoring captures Core Web Vitals accurately
- Validate error tracking integration logs exceptions with proper context
- Test alerting system triggers notifications for critical failures
- Test uptime monitoring detects service interruptions within acceptable thresholds
- Validate log aggregation captures structured logs for debugging

**Load Testing & Performance Validation:**
- Test application performance under expected production traffic loads
- Validate session management handles concurrent users without degradation
- Test database queries perform optimally under production data volumes
- Test CDN serves static assets with proper caching headers
- Validate analytics integration tracks production events accurately

**Security & Compliance Testing:**
- Test security headers implementation (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Validate CORS configuration allows only authorized domains
- Test rate limiting prevents abuse and maintains service availability
- Test SSL certificate auto-renewal and domain security configuration
