# Task ID: 17
# Title: Comprehensive Error Handling & System Resilience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 11, 14, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement complete error handling system with retry logic, user-friendly error messages, and fallback UI patterns for critical vs non-critical errors with background retry systems.
# Details:
**COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Reference Implementation Specification:**
- Primary source: /workspaces/ai-scorecard/implementation-spec/error-handling.md for all error patterns and resilience requirements
- Critical vs non-critical error classification and handling strategies
- Background retry systems with exponential backoff algorithms
- User-friendly error messaging with contextual recovery actions

**Error Classification System:**
- Critical errors: Database failures, authentication issues, payment processing failures
- Non-critical errors: Analytics tracking failures, non-essential API calls, optional feature failures
- Transient errors: Network timeouts, rate limiting, temporary service unavailability
- Permanent errors: Invalid input, authorization failures, resource not found

**Retry Logic Implementation:**
- Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s intervals)
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls with failure threshold monitoring
- Background retry queue for non-blocking error recovery with persistent storage
- Maximum retry limits based on error type (3 for critical, 5 for non-critical)

**User Experience Error Handling:**
- Toast notifications for non-blocking errors with dismissible actions
- Inline error states for form validation with specific field-level messaging
- Fallback UI components for failed data loads with retry buttons
- Loading states with timeout handling and graceful degradation patterns
- Error boundary components for React component tree error isolation

**Database & API Error Resilience:**
- Database connection pooling with retry logic and connection health monitoring
- API timeout configuration with progressive timeout increases
- HubSpot integration error handling with fallback lead capture mechanisms
- Session recovery for interrupted assessment flows with auto-save integration
- Assessment data validation with client-side and server-side error handling

**Monitoring & Alerting Integration:**
- Error logging with structured logging format and severity classification
- Error rate monitoring with threshold-based alerting for critical failures
- Performance impact tracking for error handling overhead
- User journey impact analysis for error-affected conversion funnels

# Test Strategy:
**ERROR HANDLING TDD TESTING:**

**RED Phase - Core Error Handling Tests:**
- Test error classification system correctly categorizes critical vs non-critical errors
- Validate exponential backoff retry logic with mock failures and timing verification
- Test circuit breaker pattern opens/closes based on failure thresholds
- Verify background retry queue persists and processes failed operations
- Test user-facing error messages display contextually appropriate content

**Integration Error Testing:**
- Test database connection failure scenarios with connection pool exhaustion
- Validate API timeout handling with simulated slow/failed responses
- Test HubSpot integration failures with fallback lead capture mechanisms
- Verify session recovery works correctly with interrupted assessment flows
- Test assessment data validation catches and handles malformed submissions

**User Experience Error Testing:**
- Test toast notification system displays and dismisses correctly
- Validate inline form error states show field-specific error messages
- Test fallback UI components render when data loading fails
- Verify loading states timeout gracefully with retry options
- Test React error boundaries catch and isolate component failures

**Monitoring & Performance Testing:**
- Test error logging captures structured error data with proper severity levels
- Validate error rate monitoring triggers alerts at configured thresholds
- Test performance impact of error handling doesn't degrade user experience
- Verify error tracking integration with analytics pipeline from Task 11
