# Task ID: 14
# Title: Session Management & Assessment Recovery System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive session management with 24-hour persistence, resume capability, and incomplete assessment handling with auto-save functionality and recovery flows.
# Details:
**SESSION MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Session Storage & Persistence:**
- Reference /workspaces/ai-scorecard/implementation-spec/api-specification.md for session endpoints (POST /api/sessions, GET /api/sessions/:id, PUT /api/sessions/:id)
- Reference /workspaces/ai-scorecard/implementation-spec/database-design.md for session storage requirements and auto-save patterns
- 24-hour session persistence with automatic cleanup after expiration
- Browser storage integration (localStorage/sessionStorage) with server-side synchronization
- Session token generation and validation with secure UUID implementation
- Auto-save functionality every 30 seconds during assessment progress
- Cross-tab session synchronization to prevent data loss

**Recovery & Resume System:**
- Incomplete assessment detection and recovery flow on page load
- Resume capability from any point in the assessment with progress restoration
- Session state restoration including current question, responses, and progress indicators
- Graceful handling of expired sessions with user notification and restart options
- Data integrity validation during recovery to ensure response consistency

**Session API Implementation:**
```typescript
// Session management endpoints
POST /api/sessions - Create new session
GET /api/sessions/:sessionId - Retrieve session data
PUT /api/sessions/:sessionId - Update session progress
DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId - Cleanup expired session

// Session data structure
interface SessionData {
  sessionId: string;
  userId?: string;
  responses: Record<string, string>;
  currentStep: number;
  progress: number;
  lastActivity: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
  isComplete: boolean;
}
```

**Auto-Save Integration:**
- Real-time response saving with debounced API calls
- Progress tracking with step-by-step persistence
- Network error handling with offline queue support
- Conflict resolution for concurrent session updates
- Recovery notification system with user-friendly messaging

# Test Strategy:
**SESSION MANAGEMENT TDD TESTING:**

**RED Phase - Core Session Tests:**
- Test session creation with unique ID generation and database persistence
- Validate 24-hour expiration logic with automatic cleanup functionality
- Test auto-save mechanism with 30-second intervals and debounced API calls
- Verify session recovery flow from incomplete assessments with data integrity validation
- Test cross-tab synchronization and conflict resolution scenarios

**GREEN Phase - Recovery System Tests:**
- Integration tests for session API endpoints with database operations
- Browser storage synchronization tests with server-side validation
- Network failure simulation with offline queue and recovery testing
- Session expiration handling with user notification flows
- Progressive recovery testing with various completion states

**REFACTOR Phase - Performance & Edge Cases:**
- Session cleanup job testing with bulk expiration handling
- Concurrent session update testing with race condition prevention
- Memory leak prevention in auto-save intervals and cleanup
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for storage mechanisms
- Load testing for high-volume session management scenarios
