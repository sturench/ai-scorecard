## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements

### TDD Workflow Implementation

This task MUST follow Test-Driven Development methodology. Implementation should progress through these phases:

#### ðŸ”´ RED Phase: Write Failing Tests

- [ ] **Unit Tests**: [Specific unit tests to write FIRST - these should initially fail]
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: [API endpoint tests written before implementation]
- [ ] **Component Tests**: [React component tests using React Testing Library - written before components]
- [ ] **Acceptance Tests**: [End-to-end tests for user acceptance criteria]

#### ðŸŸ¢ GREEN Phase: Minimal Implementation

- [ ] **Pass Tests**: Write minimal code to make tests pass (no over-engineering)
- [ ] **Verify Coverage**: Ensure all written tests are now passing
- [ ] **Functional Complete**: Core functionality works as defined by tests

#### ðŸ”§ REFACTOR Phase: Clean Code

- [ ] **Code Quality**: Improve code structure while maintaining test coverage
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize performance without breaking tests
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add necessary comments and documentation
- [ ] **Final Validation**: All tests still pass after refactoring

### TDD Test Categories

#### Pre-Implementation Tests (Write First)

1. **Business Logic Tests**: [Test core business rules and calculations]
2. **API Contract Tests**: [Test API endpoints meet specifications]
3. **Component Behavior Tests**: [Test UI component interactions and state]
4. **Integration Flow Tests**: [Test external service integrations]

#### Test Scenarios (Define Before Implementation)

1. **Happy Path**: [Primary success scenario - test first]
2. **Edge Cases**: [Boundary conditions and edge cases - test first]
3. **Error Conditions**: [Error handling and failure scenarios - test first]
4. **Performance**: [Load or performance testing requirements]
