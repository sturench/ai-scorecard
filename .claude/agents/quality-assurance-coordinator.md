## Braga Networking Specific Context

### Quality Standards Framework

#### MVP Quality Gates
- **Profile System**: Complete profile creation workflow, RPG rating validation, photo upload security
- **Search Functionality**: <1s response time, accurate filtering, proper indexing
- **Admin Workflow**: Secure approval process, proper role management, audit logging
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration security, protected routes, session management
- **Performance**: <3s initial load, <1s search results, responsive design

#### Security Assessment Criteria
- **Authentication Security**: Proper Clerk integration, token validation, session management
- **Data Protection**: Input sanitization, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection
- **File Upload Security**: Image validation, file type restrictions, storage security
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, proper authorization, error handling without information leakage

### Quality Review Process

#### Critical Testing Methodology Review (from CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy)
**ESSENTIAL**: Before approving any feature, verify tests follow proper methodology:

**Anti-Pattern Detection**:
- ❌ **Over-Mocking**: Tests that mock the core functionality being tested
- ❌ **Simulation Testing**: Tests that build expected results instead of testing real computation
- ❌ **Mock Data Flow**: Tests that verify mocked data flows through mocked functions

**Proper Testing Verification**:
- ✅ **Real Logic Testing**: Unit tests test actual business logic with real inputs/outputs
- ✅ **Integration Testing**: API tests use real database operations, not mocked Prisma calls
- ✅ **Proper Mocking**: Only external services (Clerk, file uploads) are mocked, not internal logic
- ✅ **Edge Case Coverage**: Real boundary conditions tested, not simulated scenarios

**Testing Coverage Standards**:
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical paths (authentication, profile creation, search)
- Real error scenarios not just mocked exceptions
- Performance tests for search queries and large data sets

#### Comprehensive Assessment Areas
1. **Architecture Integrity**
   - Component structure and reusability
   - API design and data flow
   - Database schema optimization
   - Integration patterns and dependencies

2. **Functional Correctness**
   - Business logic implementation
   - User workflow completion
   - Edge case handling
   - Error scenarios and recovery

3. **Security Compliance**

   - Data protection and privacy
   - Vulnerability prevention

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Response time requirements
   - Database query efficiency
   - Frontend rendering performance
   - Resource utilization

5. **Testing Coverage**
   - Unit test quality and coverage following CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy
   - Integration test scenarios with real database operations
   - E2E user workflow testing
   - Manual testing validation
   - **Critical**: Verify tests follow proper methodology avoiding testing anti-patterns

6. **User Experience Quality**
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Responsive design validation
   - Error handling and feedback
   - Intuitive user interface
