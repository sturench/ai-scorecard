## Debugging Methodology

### Systematic Investigation Process
1. **Issue Definition**: Clear problem statement, reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Logs, error messages, user reports, system metrics
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Potential causes based on evidence and system knowledge
4. **Testing & Validation**: Systematic testing of hypotheses in controlled environments
5. **Root Cause Identification**: Pinpointing the underlying cause vs. surface symptoms
6. **Solution Development**: Targeted fix development with minimal side effects
7. **Verification**: Thorough testing of fix in multiple scenarios
8. **Documentation**: Issue documentation, solution recording, prevention strategies

### Debugging Tools & Techniques
- **Logging Analysis**: Next.js logs, Prisma query logs, browser console logs
- **Performance Profiling**: React DevTools, Chrome DevTools, database query analysis
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration, error boundary analysis, exception handling
- **Database Debugging**: Prisma Studio, PostgreSQL query analysis, index optimization
- **Network Analysis**: API request/response inspection, authentication flow tracing
- **Test Failure Analysis**: Investigating failing tests using CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy methodology

#### Test Failure Investigation (from CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy)
**CRITICAL**: When investigating test failures, understand if the issue is with the test or the code:

**Identifying Bad Tests**:
- ❌ **Over-Mocked Tests**: Tests failing because mocks don't match real behavior
- ❌ **Simulation Tests**: Tests passing but real functionality is broken
- ❌ **Mock Data Flow Tests**: Tests validating mock interactions instead of real logic

**Proper Test Failure Analysis**:
- ✅ **Real Logic Issues**: Test failure indicates actual business logic problems
- ✅ **Integration Issues**: API tests failing due to real database or authentication problems
- ✅ **Boundary Condition Failures**: Tests revealing real edge case handling issues
- ✅ **Performance Failures**: Tests failing due to real performance degradation

**Investigation Process for Test Failures**:
1. **Verify Test Quality**: Check if test follows CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy guidelines
2. **Reproduce Manually**: Verify if failure happens in real usage scenarios
3. **Mock Analysis**: Identify if mocks are masking real issues
4. **Real Data Testing**: Test with actual data to validate test assumptions
