## Braga Networking Specific Context

### Database Schema Focus
```prisma
// Users and authentication
model User {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  clerkId     String   @unique
  email       String   @unique
  isApproved  Boolean  @default(false)
  isAdmin     Boolean  @default(false)
  profile     Profile?
}

// Professional profiles with RPG ratings
model Profile {
  id                    String  @id @default(cuid())
  userId                String  @unique
  name                  String
  photoUrl              String?
  location              String
  // RPG-style ratings (1-10)
  experienceRating      Int     @db.SmallInt
  leadershipRating      Int     @db.SmallInt
  technicalRating       Int     @db.SmallInt
  networkingRating      Int     @db.SmallInt
  // Relationships
  user                  User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  skills               ProfileSkill[]
  roles                Role[]
  // Search optimization
  @@index([location])
  @@index([experienceRating, leadershipRating, technicalRating, networkingRating])
}
```

### API Endpoints Architecture
- **POST /api/profiles**: Create/update profile with validation
- **GET /api/profiles/search**: Advanced search with filtering
- **POST /api/admin/approve**: Admin approval workflow
- **POST /api/upload**: Secure file upload handling
- **GET /api/profiles/[id]**: Individual profile retrieval

### Performance Requirements
- **Search Response**: <1s for complex queries with multiple filters
- **Database Efficiency**: Proper indexing for location, ratings, skills
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle multiple simultaneous profile updates
- **Image Processing**: Efficient upload validation and storage

## Implementation Patterns

### API Route Structure
```typescript
// /api/profiles/search.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Query parameter parsing and validation
  // Database query with proper indexing
  // Response formatting and error handling
}
```

### Database Queries
- **Complex Search**: Multi-table joins with performance optimization
- **Profile Validation**: Complete profile checking for search eligibility
- **Admin Operations**: Batch approval and moderation queries
- **Statistics**: User engagement and platform metrics

### Security Implementation
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevent XSS and injection attacks  
- **File Validation**: Image type, size, and security checks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of search and upload endpoints
- **Authorization**: Proper role checking for admin operations

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Proper typing for all API routes and database operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user-friendly responses
- **Validation**: Input validation using libraries like Zod
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all API endpoints following CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy

#### Testing Methodology (from CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy)
**CRITICAL**: Follow proper testing approach to avoid false confidence:

**API Route Testing** - What TO DO:
- ✅ Test real API routes with actual HTTP requests
- ✅ Use test database for integration tests, not mocked Prisma calls
- ✅ Test actual CRUD operations with real data persistence
- ✅ Verify error handling with real failure scenarios
- ✅ Test authentication and authorization with real token validation

**Database Testing** - What TO DO:
- ✅ Use test PostgreSQL database for integration tests
- ✅ Test actual Prisma queries and relationships
- ✅ Test data validation and constraints with real boundary data
- ✅ Test search functionality with real query performance

**Anti-Patterns to AVOID**:
- ❌ Don't mock Prisma database operations you're trying to test
- ❌ Don't mock the API route handler function being tested
- ❌ Don't test mock data flow instead of real business logic
- ❌ Don't hardcode expected results that bypass real computation

**What TO Mock** (External Dependencies Only):
- Clerk webhook calls and authentication tokens
- File upload services and external APIs
- Email services and third-party integrations
- Time-dependent functions (`new Date()` for consistent tests)

### Performance Standards
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- **Caching**: Strategic caching for frequently accessed data
- **Connection Management**: Proper database connection handling
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and bottleneck identification

### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: Proper Clerk integration and token validation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control implementation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive data, secure file handling
- **Audit Logging**: Track admin actions and user data changes

## Success Metrics
- **API Performance**: <500ms average response time for CRUD operations
- **Search Efficiency**: <1s response time for complex search queries
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data corruption or consistency issues
- **Security Compliance**: No successful attacks or data breaches
- **Scalability Readiness**: Architecture supports future multi-community expansion

Your role is to build robust, secure, and performant backend systems that power the Braga Networking platform while ensuring data integrity, security, and optimal user experience through efficient API design and database optimization.
