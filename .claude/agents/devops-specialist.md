## Braga Networking Specific Context

### Deployment Architecture

```yaml
# Production Stack
Frontend: Vercel (Next.js App Router)
Database: PostgreSQL (Neon/PlanetScale/Supabase)
Authentication: Clerk (managed service)
File Storage: Vercel Blob Storage (MVP) → Cloudinary (future)
Monitoring: Vercel Analytics + Sentry
```

### Development Environment

```yaml
# Local Development
Application: Docker container with Next.js
Database: PostgreSQL Docker container
Development Tools: Docker Compose setup
Environment: .env.local with development secrets
```

### Environment Configuration

- **Development**: Local Docker setup with test data
- **Preview**: Vercel preview deployments for feature branches
- **Production**: Vercel production with PostgreSQL hosting

## Implementation Focus Areas

### Vercel Optimization

```javascript
// next.config.ts optimization
export default {
  images: {
    domains: ['uploadthing.com'], // File upload domains
    formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
  },
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['@prisma/client'],
  },
};
```

### Docker Development Setup

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage Docker build for development
# PostgreSQL container configuration
# Development environment consistency
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Structure (Following CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# CRITICAL: Follow proper testing methodology in CI/CD pipeline

# Testing Phase Configuration:
# ✅ Real database testing with PostgreSQL test container
# ✅ Integration tests with actual API calls and database operations
# ✅ Component tests with React Testing Library (no over-mocking)
# ✅ E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows

# Anti-Pattern Prevention in CI/CD:
# ❌ Prevent deployment if tests mock core functionality being tested
# ❌ Fail pipeline if Prisma database operations are mocked instead of using test DB
# ❌ Block builds with simulation tests that don't exercise real business logic

# Pipeline Quality Gates:
# - Test database setup/teardown for consistent integration testing
# - Real API route testing with actual HTTP requests
# - Form validation testing with real Zod schemas and boundary data
# - Search functionality testing with real database queries and performance validation
```

#### CI/CD Testing Architecture (from CLAUDE.md Testing Strategy)

**CRITICAL**: Configure CI/CD pipeline to enforce proper testing methodology:

**Test Database Setup**:

```yaml
# PostgreSQL test container for integration tests
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: braga_test
    options: >-
      --health-cmd pg_isready
      --health-interval 10s
      --health-timeout 5s
      --health-retries 5
```

**Testing Pipeline Stages**:

1. **Unit Tests**: Real business logic testing (profile completion, RPG calculations)
2. **Integration Tests**: API routes with test database operations
3. **Component Tests**: React components with real props and state
4. **E2E Tests**: Critical user workflows with actual application behavior
5. **Performance Tests**: Search queries and database operations under load

**Quality Gates**:

- ✅ **80% minimum coverage** for new code
- ✅ **100% coverage** for critical paths (auth, profiles, search)
- ✅ **Real error scenario testing** not just mocked exceptions
- ✅ **Performance validation** for search (<1s) and page load (<3s) requirements

### Environment Variables Management

```bash
# Development
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/braga_dev"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_dev_..."

# Production
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prod-server/braga_prod"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."
```
