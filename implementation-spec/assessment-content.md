## Implementation Guidelines

### Question Display Format

```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string; // "value_assurance_1"
  area: string; // "value_assurance"
  title: string; // "AI Investment Tracking"
  question: string; // Full question text
  options: Array<{
    value: string; // "A", "B", "C", "D", "E"
    text: string; // Answer option text
    points: number; // 0, 5, 10, 15, 25
  }>;
  weight: number; // Area weight (0.25, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15)
}
```

### Scoring Calculation

```javascript
// Calculate area scores (0-100)
const calculateAreaScore = (questions) => {
  const totalPoints = questions.reduce((sum, q) => sum + q.selectedPoints, 0);
  const maxPoints = questions.length * 25;
  return Math.round((totalPoints / maxPoints) * 100);
};

// Calculate overall weighted score
const calculateOverallScore = (areaScores) => {
  return Math.round(
    areaScores.valueAssurance * 0.25 +
      areaScores.customerSafe * 0.35 +
      areaScores.riskCompliance * 0.25 +
      areaScores.governance * 0.15
  );
};
```

### Recommendation Generation

Based on area scores and patterns, generate personalized recommendations:

- **High Priority:** Areas scoring <50 points
- **Medium Priority:** Areas scoring 50-70 points
- **Low Priority:** Areas scoring >70 points

### Question ID Mapping

For database storage and API consistency:

- `value_assurance_1` through `value_assurance_4`
- `customer_safe_1` through `customer_safe_4`
- `risk_compliance_1` through `risk_compliance_4`
- `governance_1` through `governance_4`
